## 1. Install MAMP

2. Drag MAMP into your Applications folder
3. Launch the app, click on start in the top-right corner. 
A browser window should open displaying a welcome message. If not, open `http://localhost:8888/`manually in your browser to see if it works.
You can also change the port in the `Preferences`window

## 2. Clone the repo

```bash
# This is where you should clone your repo into
cd /Applications/MAMP/htdocs

# Clone via HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/DarioLoll/study-share.git

# OR
# Clone via SSH
git clone git@github.com:DarioLoll/study-share.git
```

2. Open the file `httpd.conf`

<?php
return [
	'host'    => 'localhost',
	'port'    => 8889,           // might need to change (usually 8889 for MAMP)
	'db'      => 'study_share',
	'user'    => 'root',         // root is default for MAMP
	'pass'    => 'root',         // root is default for MAMP
	'charset' => 'utf8mb4',
